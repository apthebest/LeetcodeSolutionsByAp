Problem Statement:
You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.

Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.

Sample Example:

Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]


--Thinking through the Problem:--

We are asked to delete the nodes between a and b inclusive and insert the list2 in that 
position.

--Thinking through the solution:--

We only need do to three things:
1)Simply get the node previous to the node at 'a' and point its next pointer to the head 
of list2
2)Store the pointer to last node of the list2 in a variable.
3)Set the next pointer of this last node to the next pointer of the node at between

And All Set...ðŸ˜Š
